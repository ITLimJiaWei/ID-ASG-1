The intent of the user audience is to learn more about the upcoming game, Cyberpunk 2077 whether its about its features or history.
The website is also supposed to draw people who enjoy video games in and give them more information of what this game offers which then
gives them a choice whether they wish to purchase it or not. The main purpose of this website is to increase sales of Cyberpunk 2077 and
also build the history/lore of the video game.

Design Process

This website is to advertise the upcoming video game Cyberpunk 2077 which is set to release on 10th December 2020. I feel like advertising
interesting and unique features the video game offers will draw gamers and non-gamers alike in to at least give the cyberpunk genre a shot.
I used several images of "Night City" the location where Cyberpunk 2077 is based in, in the wbesite so the audience has a feel of what they
are getting themselves into. Furthermore, I chose to explain the history/lore of the video game to captivate those who enjoy a good story.
I created a low-fidelity wireframe to show the overall design of this website which is included in the file submtited.

Features

Navigation Buttons - These allow the user to quickly jump to differen sections of the site if they wish to skip over certain content that
they are not interested in. They also make it easy for the user to check what type of content can be found on the site as the navigation 
buttons show the main title of the main sections of the page. 

Purchase Form - This form will allow the user to enter his/her credential information to purchase Cyberpunk 2077 if they wish after viewing
the contents of the main webpage. I chose to have it as a separate page instead of having it with the main webpage because I felt it did
fall under the same category as the other content such as History and Features.
