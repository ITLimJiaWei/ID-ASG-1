The intent of the user audience is to learn more about the upcoming game, Cyberpunk 2077 whether its about its features or history.
The website is also supposed to draw people who enjoy video games in and give them more information of what this game offers which then
gives them a choice whether they wish to purchase it or not. The main purpose of this website is to increase sales of Cyberpunk 2077 and
also build the history/lore of the video game.
